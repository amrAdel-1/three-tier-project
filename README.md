# 📰 3-Tier Blog API System

A containerized **three-tier web application** built using **Go**, **MySQL**, and **Nginx**.

---

## 🧩 Architecture

Client → Nginx (HTTPS) → Backend API (Go) → MySQL Database

---

## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates a production-style **3-tier web architecture** with:
- **Backend API (Go)** — serves REST responses with blog titles  
- **Database (MySQL)** — stores blog data persistently  
- **Proxy (Nginx)** — exposes the API securely over HTTPS  

It supports both **Docker Compose** for local testing and **Kubernetes** for production-like deployment.


## 🧱 Components

### Backend (Go)
- REST API returning a list of blog titles  
- Built using a **multi-stage Dockerfile** (build + run)  
- Connects to MySQL through environment variables  

### Database (MySQL)
- Stores blog data persistently  
- Uses **PersistentVolume** and **PersistentVolumeClaim** in Kubernetes  
- Credentials stored in `db-secret.yaml` (as a Kubernetes Secret)

### Proxy (Nginx)
- Acts as a **reverse proxy** to the backend  
- Uses HTTPS with a **self-signed SSL certificate** generated by `generate-ssl.sh`  
- Configuration defined in `nginx.conf`
